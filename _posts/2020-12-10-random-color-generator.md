Random Colour Generator displays random colour and its metadata values that can be copied to clipboard.
This app can inspire your artistic works by randomly selecting colours that you can choose from rather than picking one by yourself. A solid colour will fill your screen with optional colour data.

Features:
Randomly selects colour and displays it. Tap anywhere on screen to change colour.

Displays hex, RGB and CMYK values. This is disabled by default. To enable, goto menu (3 dots) and check "Display Values"

Copy hex value to clipboard by long press anywhere on screen
